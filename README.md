On scrolling the page, the section which is in the viewport and its corresponding navbar link are highlighted. Also, when a navbar link is clicked, the page scrolls to the corresponding section and they both are highlighted.
A back-to-top button appears at the bottom-right of the page when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
